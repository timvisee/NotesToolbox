# NotesToolbox
Toolbox project for compiling notes into PDF's, slides and some other formats!

> _I usually take notes in class (college) using the Markdown format, for easy editing.
  I use this toolbox to compile my notes into a PDF file, an interactive slideshow or some other format using a
  single, simple command. These PDF's and slides make the learning process of exam material much more efficient, as
  these formats are much easier to read and learn from._
